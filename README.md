## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## HashMaps vs TreeMaps

In Java, it's generally better to use a HashMap over a TreeMap when:

1. Fast Retrieval and Insertion are Priorities:

HashMap offers constant-time O(1) average performance for both retrieval and insertion, making it ideal for frequent access and updates.
TreeMap, while offering sorted keys, has O(log n) time complexity for these operations due to its internal structure.
2. Order of Keys is Not Important:

HashMap doesn't maintain any specific order for its keys. If you don't need to iterate over keys in sorted order, HashMap is a more efficient choice.
TreeMap, on the other hand, sorts keys in ascending order by default, incurring some overhead for this functionality.
3. Memory Efficiency is Crucial:

HashMap generally has lower memory overhead compared to TreeMap, as it doesn't require additional space for maintaining the sorted order of keys.
Common Use Cases for HashMap:

Caching data for quick access
Implementing dictionaries or lookup tables
Storing user session data
Maintaining frequency counts
Implementing graph data structures

When to Consider TreeMap:

Key Order is Essential: If you need to iterate over keys in sorted order, TreeMap is necessary.
Range-Based Operations: TreeMap excels in operations like finding a range of keys or retrieving keys greater than or less than a certain value.
Key Points:

HashMap: Unordered, fast retrieval and insertion, lower memory overhead.
TreeMap: Sorted keys, slower retrieval and insertion, higher memory overhead.
